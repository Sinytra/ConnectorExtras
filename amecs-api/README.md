## Usage
 If you're not a modder you're probably looking for [Amecs](https://github.com/Siphalor/amecs).
 
 If you **are** a modder then you can use Amecs with the following in your build.gradle:
 
 ```groovy
repositories {
    maven {
        url "https://maven.siphalor.de/"
        name "Siphalor's Maven"
    }
}

// VERSION: Check the badge above for the latest version
// MINECRAFT_VERSION: The major Minecraft version you're developing for (e.g. 1.15 for 1.15.2)
dependencies {
    include(modImplementation("de.siphalor:amecsapi-MINECRAFT_VERSION:VERSION"))
}
```

## Features

If you want to see some example of how to use this library, you can take a look at the [testmod](./src/testmod/java/de/siphalor/amecs/testmod).

### Modifier Keys

Modifier keys can be set by the user for all keybindings, including Vanilla ones.

If you want to define a keybinding that uses modifier keys for its default value, you can extend the [`AmecsKeyBinding`](./src/main/java/de/siphalor/amecs/api/AmecsKeyBinding.java) class.

If you want to further integrate this library, check the [`KeyBindingUtils`](./src/main/java/de/siphalor/amecs/api/KeyBindingUtils.java) class.

### Priority Keybindings

Priority keybindings are keybindings that are executed before all other keybindings and are allowed to cancel further evaluation.  
This has various use cases, for example:

- Keybindings that work when not in-game
- Keybindings that work regardless if the chat or a GUI is open

You can make use of priority keybindings by implementing the [`PriorityKeyBinding`](src/main/java/de/siphalor/amecs/api/PriorityKeyBinding.java) interface.

Please always carefully check if your priority keybinding takes action in the right context.  
For example, you oftentimes don't want to execute your priority keybinding when the chat is open.

### Keybinding Descriptions

Keybinding descriptions are a way to provide a description for a keybinding that are shown as a tooltip when hovering over the keybinding in the controls menu.

You can add descriptions by defining translations for the keybinding's translation key with the suffix `.amecsapi.description`.
